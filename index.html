                          <p class="">Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people.

                          <p class="">It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object
                              that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their
                              eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                          <p class="">In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there
                              is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped
